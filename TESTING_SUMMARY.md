## 🔍 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Test Path References ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Tests were running from `tests/` directory but looking for files with relative paths expecting project root.

**Solution:** Updated all test classes to use `get_project_root()` and construct absolute paths.

**Files Modified:**
- `tests/end_to_end_test.py` - Added project_root to all test classes

### Issue 2: GUI Tests Failing in Headless Environment ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** GUI import tests were failing when tkinter was unavailable, even though this is an expected environment limitation.

**Solution:** Updated GUI tests to skip gracefully when `TKINTER_AVAILABLE` is False instead of failing.

**Files Modified:**
- `tests/end_to_end_test.py` - Added skipTest() for GUI tests when tkinter unavailable
