4. **Avoid Duplicates:** Ensure your contribution isn't already in progress

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AndroRAT.git
cd AndroRAT

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/shadow-dragon-2002/AndroRAT.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Android development, import Android_Code into Android Studio
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch for your changes
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 4. Set Up Development Environment

**For Server Development:**
```bash
# Test the CLI
python3 server/androRAT.py --help

# Test the GUI
python3 server/androRAT_advanced_gui.py
```

**For Android Development:**
1. Open `Android_Code` in Android Studio
2. Sync Gradle files
3. Build the project
4. Run on emulator or device

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Use type hints where appropriate

**Example:**
```python
def build_apk(ip_address: str, port: int, output_file: str) -> bool:
    """
    Build an APK with specified configuration.
    
    Args:
        ip_address: Server IP address
        port: Server port number
        output_file: Output APK file path
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if build succeeded, False otherwise
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Java Code Style

- Follow Android coding conventions
- Use meaningful class and method names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle Android API level differences properly
- Use appropriate Android lifecycle methods

**Example:**
```java
/**
 * Request necessary permissions for Android 15+
 */
@TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM)
private void requestAndroid15Permissions() {
    // Implementation
}
```

### General Guidelines

- **Keep changes minimal and focused** - One PR per feature/fix
- **Write clear commit messages** - Use descriptive messages
- **Add comments for complex code** - Help others understand
- **Handle errors gracefully** - Don't let exceptions crash the app
- **Test edge cases** - Consider unusual scenarios
- **Maintain backward compatibility** - Unless breaking changes are necessary

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

**All Tests:**
```bash
python3 run_all_tests.py
```

**Specific Test Suites:**
```bash
# Android 15/16 compatibility
cd tests
python3 test_android_15_16_upgrade.py

# APK integrity
python3 apk_integrity_checker.py /path/to/test.apk

# Comprehensive tests
python3 -m unittest comprehensive_test.ComprehensiveAndroRATTests
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and methods
2. **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests:** Test complete workflows
4. **Compatibility Tests:** Test across Android versions

**Test Structure:**
```python
import unittest

class MyFeatureTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test fixtures"""
        pass
    
    def test_specific_functionality(self):
        """Test specific feature"""
        # Arrange
        # Act
        # Assert
        pass
    
    def tearDown(self):
        """Clean up after tests"""
        pass
```

### Test Requirements
