# Security Policy

## Overview

Security is a critical aspect of AndroRAT, especially given its nature as an educational remote administration tool. This document outlines our security policy, vulnerability reporting procedures, and best practices.

## üéØ Educational Purpose

**Important Notice:**

AndroRAT is developed and maintained for **educational and security research purposes only**. This tool is designed to:

- Teach Android security concepts
- Demonstrate remote administration techniques
- Support authorized security research
- Educate about Android vulnerabilities

**This tool must NOT be used for:**

- Unauthorized access to devices
- Malicious activities
- Illegal operations
- Privacy violations
- Any activity without explicit authorization

## üîí Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Android Support |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Latest (master) | ‚úÖ Full support | Android 6.0-16 (API 23-36) |
| v2.x    | ‚úÖ Security updates | Android 6.0-16 (API 23-36) |
| v1.x    | ‚ùå No longer supported | Legacy |

**Recommendation:** Always use the latest version from the `master` branch for the most up-to-date security features and bug fixes.

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow our responsible disclosure process.

### Preferred Reporting Method: GitHub Security Advisory

**For sensitive security vulnerabilities, please use GitHub's private Security Advisory feature:**

1. Navigate to the [Security tab](https://github.com/shadow-dragon-2002/AndroRAT/security)
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Fill out the security advisory form with:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Affected versions
   - Suggested fix (if available)

**Benefits of Security Advisories:**
- Private, secure communication
- Coordinated disclosure timeline
- CVE assignment if applicable
- Credit for discovery

### Alternative Reporting Methods

If you cannot use Security Advisory:

1. **GitHub Issues (Non-Sensitive Only)**
   - Use the Security Issue template
   - DO NOT include sensitive exploit details
   - Only for minor security improvements

2. **Direct Contact**
   - Contact maintainers via GitHub
   - Clearly mark communications as security-related
   - Use PGP encryption if available

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Description:** Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact:** Potential security impact and severity
- **Affected Components:** Which parts of the codebase are affected
- **Affected Versions:** Which versions contain the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed reproduction steps
- **Proof of Concept:** Code or steps demonstrating the issue (privately)
- **Suggested Fix:** Recommendations for patching (if available)
- **References:** Related CVEs or security advisories

### What NOT to Include (Publicly)

**Never include in public issues:**
- Working exploit code
- Detailed attack vectors
- Specific vulnerable code locations
- Information that could enable immediate exploitation

## üìã Vulnerability Disclosure Process

Our responsible disclosure timeline:

1. **Report Received** (Day 0)
   - Acknowledgment within 48 hours
   - Initial assessment and triage

2. **Investigation** (Days 1-7)
   - Reproduce and verify the issue
   - Assess severity and impact
   - Determine affected versions

3. **Fix Development** (Days 7-30)
   - Develop and test fix
   - Create security patch
   - Prepare security advisory

4. **Coordinated Disclosure** (Day 30+)
   - Release security fix
   - Publish security advisory
   - Credit reporter (if desired)

### Severity Levels

We use the following severity classifications:

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, data breach | 24-48 hours |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, auth bypass | 7 days |
| **Medium** | Information disclosure, DoS | 30 days |
| **Low** | Minor security improvements | 90 days |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

**Deployment Security:**

1. **Use Strong Credentials**
   - Never use default passwords
   - Use complex, unique passwords
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **Secure Your Environment**
   - Use TLS for all communications
   - Deploy on secure networks
   - Keep systems updated

3. **Legal Authorization**
   - Only use on devices you own or have explicit permission to access
   - Comply with all applicable laws
   - Document authorization

4. **Privacy Protection**
   - Respect user privacy
   - Secure collected data
   - Follow data protection regulations

### For Developers

**Contribution Security:**

1. **Code Review**
   - Review all code changes for security issues
   - Never commit secrets or credentials
   - Use secure coding practices

2. **Testing**
   - Test security features thoroughly
   - Include security test cases
   - Validate input handling

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review dependency security advisories
   - Use known secure libraries

4. **Documentation**
   - Document security features
   - Provide security guidance
   - Update security documentation

## üö´ Known Limitations

**Security Considerations:**

1. **Educational Tool**
   - Designed for education, not production security
   - May not include enterprise-grade security features
   - Requires responsible use

2. **Android Versions**
   - Security features vary by Android version
   - Older Android versions have fewer protections
   - Always use the latest Android version when possible

3. **Network Security**
   - Requires secure network configuration
   - Vulnerable to network-based attacks if misconfigured
   - TLS configuration is critical

4. **Detection**
   - May be detected by antivirus software
   - May be flagged by Google Play Protect
   - This is expected for educational RAT tools
